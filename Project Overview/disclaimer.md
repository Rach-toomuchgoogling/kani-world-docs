Kani World is an evolving NFT game. All NFTs and tokens connected to the game
are player-owned game items and not an investment. The game is constantly
developing, and you might encounter problems or errors. While I will attempt to
fix these problems, there is no guarantee to be compensated for any loss. Kani
World currently relies on Discord, and changes from Discord may make the game
unplayable. The game assets require the Algorand blockchain, and downtime to
the blockchain may impact the playability of the game. Finally, all NFTs
purchased are for playing the game in its current state. Purchasing a Kani does
not guarantee future developments.
