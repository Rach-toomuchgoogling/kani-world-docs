# Defeat the Raid Boss
Many dangers lurk in the depths of the ocean. Every 6 hours a randomly
generated boss attacks Kani World. Players must work together to attack and
defeat it before too much damage is done. Players will be notified when a raid
starts. Once a raid has started players can use the
[`?raid`](/docs/commands/#pve) command to attack the boss. There is a two hour
cooldown on this command after which players can attack again if the boss still
has not been defeated.

For more information on how raids work and the strengths and weaknesses of the
raid bosses check out the [raid gameplay guide](/docs/gameplay/raids.md).

Now you are ready to become a Kani king. Check out the
[gameplay guides](/docs/gameplay) for more detailed information on the various
aspects of the game as well.
