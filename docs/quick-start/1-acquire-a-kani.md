# Acquire a Kani
1. You will need a Discord account and to have joined the [Kani World server](https://discord.gg/Npybs2RTwV).
2. Next you will need some $ALGO and an Algorand wallet to get started. For
   wallets it is recommended to use [Pera](https://perawallet.app) or
   [Defly](https://defly.app/).
   - Pera Android: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.algorand.android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.algorand.android)
   - Pera iOS: [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/algorand-wallet/id1459898525](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/algorand-wallet/id1459898525)
   - Pera Web: [https://web.perawallet.app](https://web.perawallet.app)

3. Purchase a Kani and add it to your wallet.
   - You can try your luck in the
     [`#kani-shuffle`](/docs/channels/kani-shuffle) channel.
   - Or check out the secondary market on [nftexplorer.app](https://www.nftexplorer.app/sellers/kani-world).
   - Or try to pick up a Kani in the [`#kani-traders`](/docs/channels/kani-traders) channel.
4. Go to the [`#verify`](/docs/channels/verify) channel and run the
   [`?verify <wallet address>`](/docs/commands/#verify) command to register
   your wallet. The bot will delete your message, check you have a Kani, and
   give you the appropriate Discord server role. 
5. Add the Kani Coin ASA (ID: `638594993`) to your wallet as in game rewards
   are automatically distributed weekly. If you wish to keep your Kani Coin in
   the game use [`?auto-dis off`](/docs/commands/#auto-dis).

Once verified you will be able to access the game channels and start playing
the game.
