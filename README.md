# Development
You will need to install [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org). Then clone this
repository and cd into it. From there you can install jekyll and the
plugins with this commmand:

```shell
bundle install
```

Once everything is installed you can run the jekyll server locally to see your
changes in real-time.

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

# Tools
## Jekyll
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) is a static site generator. It takes text
written in your favorite markup language and uses layouts to create a static
website. You can tweak the siteâ€™s look and feel, URLs, the data displayed on
the page, and more.

## Just the Docs
[Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/) gives your
documentation a jumpstart with a responsive Jekyll theme that is easily
customizable and hosted on GitHub Pages.
