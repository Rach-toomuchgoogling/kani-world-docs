Treasure hunting works similarly to [exploring](/docs/gameplay/explore).
Players will send a crab out to explore the blockchain ocean, searching the
blocks for hidden treasure. The longer they stay out the more blocks they will
search and the greater the chance they find something special. Just donâ€™t leave
them out too long as the Kani tend to get distracted and explore less
diligently the longer they are out.

If you have at least three Kani then it would be a good idea to
[assign](/docs/commands/#role) one of them the hunter role and send him out on
a treasure hunting expedition with the [`?hunt start`](/docs/commands/#hunt)
command. You can then recall him with the [`?hunt end`](/docs/commands/#hunt)
command. The possible rewards include:

- [Scum](/glossary/#scum)
- [Blockchain Fragments](/glossary/#blockchain-fragment)
- [Consumable Items](/glossary/#consumable-item)
- NFTs

> The optimal end time for your treasure hunter is 22,222 blocks. You can check
> on the status of your treasure hunter by running the
> [`?hunt`](/docs/commands/#hunt) command.
