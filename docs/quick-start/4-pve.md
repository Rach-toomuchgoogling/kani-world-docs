# Challenge a Creature
You can use the [`?pve`](/docs/commands/#pve) command to challenge a randomly
generated monster. Like the [`?scavenge`](/docs/commands/#scavenge) command
from the previous step, this command is on a 10 hour cooldown. The creatures
have similar stats to a Kani and rewards are generated based on the enemy's
stats and the attackers [appeal](/glossary/#appeal) value. As your Kani gets
stronger you can challenge higher difficulties by adding a number after the
command (e.g. `?pve 3`). This increases the difficulty and the reward.
