# Scum
Scum is an in game only resource which players collect in order to
[buff](/docs/commands/#buff) the stats of their Kani. Scum can be acquired in a
variety of ways, some common ones are:
- Scavenge
- PVE
- PVP
- Raids
- Weekly Events

# Buff
The main way to improve a Kani's stats is through playing the games, collecting
scum, and using that scum to buff your Kani. Please remember all buffs are
valid for the week and reset after the KGE. The buff increases the stat point
by 2 points and the price of each buff increases with each buff.

{: .pro-tip }
> If you buff in multiples of 4 or 5 it is slightly cheaper than buffing
> individually.

{: .pro-tip }
> Most players choose to buff only their rumbler, and focus on buffing the stat
> associated with their Kani's special move to ensure more damage and better
> results in the raids.

# Consumable Item
Consumable items are in game items and can be used to increase the stat related
to the item. There are initially 5 different items, 1 for each of the base
stats. The effect of the item is temporary lasting until the buff reset. The
items will be placed into a playerâ€™s bag once acquired and can be used with the
[`?consume`](/docs/commands/#consume) command, note the amount is not needed
and the command will use 1 if it is excluded. Alternatively, the items can also
be listed on the Kani World Marketplace for either scum or Kani Coin.
