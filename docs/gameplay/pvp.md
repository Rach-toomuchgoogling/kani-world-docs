# Player vs. Player (PvP)

## Battle Points
Battle points are a way to track who is the most successful player in PvP
encounters. Every PvP encounter awards battle points for both the winner and
the loser. Winning a PvP rewards 3 points while losing gives 1 point. 

## Monthly PVP Tournaments
The battle points are used for a monthly PvP tournament in which the top 10
places are awarded KC and the top player wins an NFT. These tournaments start
and end with the full moon KGE, about every 4 weeks. Rewards for the top 10
players are as follows: 
- 30 tokens to the top player 
- 25 tokens to places 2 and 3 
- 20 tokens to 4th to 6th 
- 15 tokens to 7th to 10th
