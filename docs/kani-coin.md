## Kani Shuffle
Bi-weekly shuffles to get one of the new babies from the KGE. There are usually
around 5 babies available in the shuffles, winning the Kani Shuffle gives you
access to the ALGOxNFT shuffle for the week. To enter, in the `#kani-shuffle`
channel, the shuffle use `!enter` for registered players or `!enter <wallet>`
for non registered players. I collect the wallet up front as it saves time in
creating the WL for the ALGOxNFT shuffle.

## Kani Traders
This is a place to sell/request/trade Kani. If new players are looking to pick
up a Kani this is a great place to ask.
