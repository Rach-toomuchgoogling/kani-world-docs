## Kappas Craft House: Item Crafting
This discord channel is where you can attempt to craft an item. You will need to
bring your [blockchain fragments](/glossary/#blockchain-fragment) and your Kani
Coin.  The fee for each item type will vary. You can use [`?blueprints`](/docs/commands/#blueprints) to view the
fee for each item. See [item crafting](/docs/gameplay/items) for more details.
See [here](/docs/gameplay/items#item-crafting) for more details.


### Name Change
You can use Kani Coin to change the name of your Kani. This will change the
display name in game as well as update the ARC69 metadata with your name in the
NFT description. The fee for changing a name is 10 KC. Use the
[`?name`](/docs/commands/#name) command to update your Kani's name.

### Special Move Reroll
Sometimes Kani are generated with undesirable
[special moves](/glossary/#special-move), i.e. a Kani has the *Claw Crush*
special, but a power of 5. You can use Kani Coin to reroll your special to a
different one that better suits your build and your Kani's base stats. The fee
starts at 10 KC and increases by 10 for each use to a maximum of 50 KC. Each
roll will give you an equal chance at any of the special moves excluding your
current special. Use the [`?reroll`](/docs/commands/#reroll) command to change
your Kani's special move.
