# #mangroves-scavenge-here
This is the game channel in which you can execute a variety of
[bot commands](/docs/commands). But primarily it is used to scavenge for scum
with the [`?scavenge`](/docs/commands/#scavenge) command.

You will also use this channel to manage your
[explorer](/docs/gameplay/explore) Kani and
[treasure hunter](/docs/gameplay/treasure-hunt) Kani.
