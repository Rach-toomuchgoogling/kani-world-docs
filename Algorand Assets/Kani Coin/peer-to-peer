## Peer to Peer 
While both algo and scum (in-game item) are both  used to facilitate many trades 
between players, Kani Coin sees heavy useage as well.

## Kani Coin Auctions
Kani Coin Auctions is a channel for any auction in Kani Coin. Community members
are welcome to list anything they like in this channel and moderate the
auctions themselves. Please be careful when using this channel as all
auctions/sales/trades are the responsibility of the parties involved in the
auction. When completing trades I recommend using
[Swapper Tools](https://app.swapper.tools) or
[Nexus App](https://app.nexusasa.com) to stay safe.

## Bounty Hunters
This channel is where community members are welcome to post bounties. Please
keep the bounties appropriate and to the rules of the server.



## Kappas Marketplace
The marketplace is a place to trade
[blockchain fragments](/glossary/#blockchain-fragment) and
[consumable items](/glossary/#consumable-item) with other players. Each player
is limited to one listing at a time. Creating a new listing will overwrite your
existing listing.

{: .warning }
> The marketplace is very basic and has had limited testing. Use at your own
> risk.

### Marketplace Commands
- [`?market`](/docs/commands/#market) shows all current listings. Each item is
  given an index number which you will need when attempting to purchase from
  the market.
- [`?buy`](/docs/commands/#buy) this is where the UX is not so nice, apologies
  everyone! You will need to enter the price and currency as a confirmation you
  are purchasing the correct item.
- [`?sell`](/docs/commands/#sell) again sorry for the poor UX. The item will
  need to be entered as it is in your [`?bag`](/docs/commands/#bag) (e.g.
  `fragment-0`). You can ask for either `scum` or `kc`.
- [`?cancel`](/docs/commands/#cancel) this will remove your current listing
  from the market.
