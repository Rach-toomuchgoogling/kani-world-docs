# Challenge a Player
You can use the [`?pvp`](/docs/commands/#pvp) command to challenge another
player's rumbler kani. Like the [`?scavenge`](/docs/commands/#scavenge) and
[`?pve`](/docs/commands/#pve) commands from the previous steps, this command is
on a 10 hour cooldown. If the player has less than 50 scum, you will not get
any reward. If the player has more than 50 scum you will get a base amount plus
a percentage of the total (if you win the battle). If the attacked player has
no Kani at home defending their stash and more than 50 scum, you will be free
to raid the scum stash.
