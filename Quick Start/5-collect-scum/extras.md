## Random PvP
Every 90 minutes two random explorers are selected to battle each other. The
victor will have blocks added to their explore time at the expense of the
opponent. Occasionally a long lost Kani will be found when this happens the
gained block count can be very large so if your explorer won the battle be sure
to recall them soon.


## Random PvE
Every 90 minutes an exploring Kani is chosen at random to fight a randomly
generated monster. If the Kani wins the attack then blocks will be added to
their explore time. However, if they lose then blocks will be subtracted from
their explore time.
