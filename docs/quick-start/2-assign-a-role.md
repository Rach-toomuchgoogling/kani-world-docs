# Assign a Role
You can go ahead and use the [`?role`](/docs/commands/#role) command to assign
the desired role to your Kani. For example to assign the **Rumbler** role to
the Kani with ASA ID `394252318` you would run this command in the
[`#mangroves-scavenge-here`](/docs/channels/mangroves-scavenge-here) channel.

```
?role 394252318 rumbler
```
