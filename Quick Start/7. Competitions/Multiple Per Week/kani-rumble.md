# Kani Rumble
The Kani rumble is a royal rumble style event where all Kani who enter are
randomly picked to battle each other until 1 Kani remains undefeated. For each
battle the Kani's health and stats reset similarly to the
[KGE](/docs/gameplay/kani-generating-event). There are no rounds and 2 Kani for
each battle are picked randomly from the pool of contenders.
