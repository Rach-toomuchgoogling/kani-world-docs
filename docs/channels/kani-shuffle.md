# #kani-shuffle
This channel is open to everyone and here owners and non-owners alike can enter
into periodic shuffles to pick up a new Kani at mint price.

There are two ways to enter the shuffle.
1. If you are a verified Kani owner. You can just run the `!enter` command.
   This will register your current game wallet with the shuffle bot.
2. If you do not yet own a Kani then you will need to provide your wallet
   address to the shuffle bot. Just run the `!enter <wallet>` command replacing
   `<wallet>` with your Algorand wallet address. No need to worry about other
   players seeing it. As soon as the bot processes your entry it will delete
   the original message.

## I won, now what?
After the shuffle contest closes Calver will set up a shuffle on ALGOxNFT with
the addresses of the winners. Only the winners will be able to purchase a Kani.
Calver will notify players when the shuffle is live. If this is your first
Kani, head on over to the [quick start](/docs/quick-start) guide to get
verified.
