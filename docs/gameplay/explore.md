# Explore
The seafloor contains many nooks and crannies where scum can be found. You can
send your Kani out exploring while you are away from the game. Use the
[`?explore`](/docs/commands/#explore) command to send out your Kani. By default
this will use the Kani with the explorer role. If you only have one Kani you
can explore with your rumbler, but be careful as it will leave your stash of
scum undefended from other players. This command sends your Kani out to explore
and collect scum passively while you are waiting for the cooldowns to reset. An
exploring Kani will not be able to defend the stash in the event of an attack
or be used in event.

After leaving your Kani out exploring for a while you can recall him from his
adventures with the [`?recall`](/docs/commands/#recall) command. When he
returns he will add any collected scum to your stash. He may also return with a
[Blockchain Fragment](/glossary/#blockchain-fragment) which you can use in
[Item Crafting](/glossary/#item-crafting). Once a Kani has been recalled it can
then be used for PVE, PVP, and other events.

{: .pro-tip }
> If you have 2 Kani, recall every other time you scavenge/pve or after about
> 20hrs not after 10 hours.

{: .pro-tip }
> The optimal recall time for your explorer depends on his speed, but in
> general is around 17,000 blocks. You can check on the status of your explorer
> by running the [`?hunt`](/docs/commands/#hunt) command.
