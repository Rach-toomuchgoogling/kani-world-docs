# Join Discord
1. You will need a Discord account and to have joined the [Kani World server](https://discord.gg/Npybs2RTwV).

4. Go to the [`#verify`](/docs/channels/verify) channel and run the
   [`?verify <wallet address>`](/docs/commands/#verify) command to register
   your wallet. The bot will delete your message, check you have a Kani, and
   give you the `@Kani Owner` role. 


Once verified you will be able to access the game channels and start playing
the game.
