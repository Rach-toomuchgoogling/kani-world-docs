## Accumulating Kani Coin
Kani Coin can be earnt in three main ways. Passive earnings are sent directly 
to your Algorand wallet, while Kani Coin earnt in game is accumulated in the 
discord bot and then sent to your wallet weekly, unless you have chosen to 
switch off automatic distribution.


### Passive Earning
Each playable Kani NFT earns 3 Kani Coin per week sent directly to accumulate in your wallet.


### Kani Raids
Participating in Kani Raids against common enemies are an excellent opportunity
to earn some extra Kani Coin. Bosses spawn every 6 hours, and 3-4 KC can usually
be earnt per player per raid.

### Prizes
Kani Coin is often given as prizes by the Kani World team for royal rumbles held
in discord, ad weekly tournaments for casual players (held at the same time as the KGE)
