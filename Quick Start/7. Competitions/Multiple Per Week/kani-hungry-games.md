# Kani Hungry Games

The Kani Hungry Games is a rumble style PVP event. The Kani for each battle are
picked from the pool of all eligible Kani similar to the Kani rumble. However,
unlike the [Kani Rumble](/docs/gameplay/kani-rumble), in the KHG the stats are
not reset between battles and carry over into the next battle. This makes it
harder for 1 extra strong Kani to dominate the battles.
