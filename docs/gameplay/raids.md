# PVE Raids
There are raids every 6 hours. For each raid a random boss is chosen and
players must attack to defeat it before it does too much damage to Kani World.
Players will be notified when a raid starts. 

## Attacking
Attacks on the bosses are on a 2hr cooldown. The amount of damage a player does
is based on the stat of their special ability
(more on specials in buffs-and-builds). Each attack has a 25% chance of being a
special move attack dealing extra damage. 

## Rewards
The raid bosses have scum, Kani coin, and blockchain fragments for rewards. The
higher the damage a player does to the boss the more scum they will receive. A
player must do damage to earn Kani coin. And each boss has a 50% chance to drop
a [blockchain fragment][/glossary/#blockchain-fragment] to all players who
attack.

## The Bosses
There are 5 bosses, each 1 is vulnerable to a different attack type (based on
the [special move](/glossary/#special-move) of the Kani) and resistant to
another type of attack. 

| Name            | Vulnerable | Resistant |
