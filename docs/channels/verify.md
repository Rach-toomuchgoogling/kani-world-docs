# #verify
As a new player you will use this channel to interact with the verification
bot. This bot will check your Algorand address to see if it contains a Kani
World NFT. If an NFT is found then you will be granted the `@Kani Owner`
Discord server role.

# Verification Bot Commands
## `?verify`
This command will check your Algorand address for a Kani World NFT and grant
you the `@Kani Owner` Discord server role. You only need to run this for your
first Kani. To load any subsequent Kani NFTs just run
[`?mykani`](/docs/commands/#mykani) in the
[#kani-flex](/docs/channels/kani-flex) channel. Once you are verified head over
to the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide to get started.

This command requires one argument:

| Argument | Description                   |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| Address  | Your Algorand wallet address. |
