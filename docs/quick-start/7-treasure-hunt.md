# Hunt for Treasure
Treasure hunting works similarly to the exploring described in the
[previous step](/quick-start/6-explore). Players will send a crab out to
explore the blockchain ocean, searching the blocks for hidden treasure. The
longer they stay out the more blocks they will search and the greater the
chance they find something special. Just donâ€™t leave them out too long as the
Kani tend to get distracted and explore less diligently the longer they are
out.

If you have at least three Kani then it would be a good idea to
[assign](/docs/commands/#role) one of them the hunter role and send him out on
a treasure hunting expedition with the [`?hunt start`](/docs/commands/#hunt)
command. You can then recall him with the [`?hunt end`](/docs/commands/#hunt)
command. The possible rewards include:

- [Scum](/glossary/#scum)
- [Blockchain Fragments](/glossary/#blockchain-fragment)
- [Consumable Items](/glossary/#consumable-item)
- NFTs

You can check on the status of your treasure hunter by running the
[`?hunt`](/docs/commands/#hunt) command. Recalling close to 22,222 blocks of
hunt time gives a higher chance of returning with one of the more valuable
rewards.
